           <b>Implementation of 3 to 8 Decoder using QCA Technology:</b> 
        Implemented a 3-to-8 decoder using Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) technology,
        focusing on nano-scale digital logic design. The project involved creating a QCA-based
        layout for the decoder, optimizing it for reduced cell count, minimal area, and low energy
        dissipation. Through detailed simulation and analysis, the design was validated for accurate
        output generation and efficient performance.

            <b>Designed webpage using React.js:</b> <br>
        Developed a responsive web application featuring a dashboard and a registration form as
        separate screens using React.js, HTML, and JavaScript. The dashboard displays content on
        the web page, while the registration form includes form validations and user-friendly input
        handling. This project highlights my skills in building dynamic web interfaces and efficiently
        managing applications.

        <b>Project on Portfolio:</b>
        I have created my portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills in front-end development. The HTML provides the structure, CSS ensures the design is responsive and visually appealing, and JavaScript adds dynamic functionality to enhance the user experience.
        This portfolio highlights my ability to combine these technologies to create a user-friendly interface, manage interactive elements, and design layouts that adapt to different devices. It reflects my dedication to building efficient, responsive, and visually appealing web applications.
